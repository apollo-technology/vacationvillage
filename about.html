    <p style="margin:40px;">Vacation Village, a ten-acre high quality mobile home development for seniors aged 55 and older, includes 300 feet of frontage on the beautiful shores of Bass Lake in downtown Elk Rapids. Bass Lake is a 140-acre spring fed inland lake situated just across the road from Lake Michigan. Typical homes at Vacation Village are the type with greatly advanced aesthetic qualities such as cathedral ceilings, fireplaces and two full bathrooms. Many residents add decks to enjoy views of the lake right from their own lot. Our heavily wooded property includes residential common areas for the enjoyment of all our residents. Residents of the park enjoy all the amenities of lakeside living, including a secluded picnic area and private boat launch. Vacation Village is between Elk Lake and Lake Michigan, across the street from the Elk Rapids Public Golf Course. We have 65 beautiful sites available with one-year lease opportunities. All city-operated utilities are available, including cable television, as we are located within the village limits of Elk Rapids. Vacation Village residents include those who reside with us part-time as well as the whole year, and those people who live and work in the downstate area of Michigan and commute to Elk Rapids on the weekends. Often, residents moor their boats in the nearby harbor and wish to enjoy a convenient, affordable home in a community setting. Although Vacation Village residents hail from all over the United States, the one important thing they have in common is the desire to spend their recreational time celebrating the Northern Michigan experience. Reasons to live the Northern Michigan experience vary amongst our residents. Many people come for sailing, motor-boating or paddling in the harbors of Lake Michigan and Elk Lake; exciting fishing and golf opportunities; many have friends and family in our area and a desire to spend time closer to loved ones; most enjoy being part of a "community" with all the benefits of residing in an area with friends and neighbors valuing the same qualities. There's such an incredible selection of activities available close to Vacation Village, you may discover that you need to make extra time for lazing away the day on a porch swing. Time spent at Vacation Village will re-generate and relax you no matter how you choose to spend your time with us. Come and visit us, we welcome you now because we know you'll want to stay!</p>
